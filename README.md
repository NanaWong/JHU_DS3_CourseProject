# Getting and Cleaning Data
There are 30 people take part in this experiment and they are separated into two groups (test and train). This experiment records data of six different activities from 30 participants. 

Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to create a R script name run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5 - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

How does the R Script work:
Download the run_analysis.R file, then open and run it in Rstudio. A file called FinalData.txt will be generated in your working directory.
